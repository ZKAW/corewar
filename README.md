Grade: A* (61.9%)
VM: 10/10

We pushed bad error handling on ASM before delivery, that cost us a lot of percentage.
If you modify or remove some of the error handling, you can pass more tests
(especially data structure).

## Setup
```bash
make

## Usage
```bash
./corewar/corewar [-dump nbr_cycle] [[-n prog_number] [-a load_address ] prog_name] ...
